New Game Idea:
	something to do with epic particle physics?
	Magic?
	Attacking?

Beat The Blocks:
	top down. blocks are coming at you from the top. you need to defend yourself with your magic mortars at the bottom
	force prestige when you die.

Guns:
	Triangles: fast attack, burst fire
	Ring: shoot exploding, magic orbs (from center of ring)
	Circle: shoot lighting (line rotating on it like a propellor)
	crossbow: shoots piercing bolts (triangle pointing down, line pointing up)
	flamethrower: concave trapazoid type beat?
